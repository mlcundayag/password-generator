## Description
This challenge requires me to create a random password generator with criterias likes (1) length of password which has a parameters of 8 to 128 as minimum and maximum, respectively, (2) character types which consist of upper & lower case, numeric, and special characters.

I divided the tasks into three steps:
* JS - Since the codes are already given, I started with manipulating the JS file. Normally, I would started with HTML, but in this case it is easier to work in reverse and figure out the optimal solution to achieve the best possible outcome. I started with adding my variables which are in this case are my character types, and as well as, the input for each buttons and checkboxes. I then worked on getting my function to generate a random using the *Math.floor* and *Math.random*. After that, I worked on connecting my generated password button and windows alert function. Lastly, I added a button event listener to copy the generated password to clipboard. 
* HTML - Simultaneously working with JS, I added tags and input/label to get the outcome I wanted.
* CSS - Lastly, I changed the styling to update the overall theme of the webpage. I also adjusted the settings depending on the screen size using media query.
