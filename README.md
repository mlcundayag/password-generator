## Description
This challenge requires me to create a random password generator with criterias likes (1) length of password which has a parameters of 8 to 128 as minimum and maximum, respectively, (2) character types which consist of upper and lower case, numeric, and special characters.

I divided the tasks into three steps:
* JS - in this case, since the codes are already given, I started with manipulating the JS file. Normally, I would start with HTML, but in this case it is easier to work in reverse and figure out the optimal solution to achieve the criteria. I started with adding my variables which in this case are my character types, and as well as, the input for each buttons and checkboxes. I then worked on getting my function to generate a random using *Math.floor* and *Math.random*. After that, I worked on connecting my generate password button and alert system. Lastly, I added a button to copy the generated password to clipboard. 
* HTML - I added tags and input/label to get the outcome I wanted.
* CSS - Lastly, I changed the styling to update overall theme of the webpage. I also adjust settings depending on the screen size.
